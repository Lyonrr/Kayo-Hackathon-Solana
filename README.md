# Solana-Summer-Camp

Hi Solana team! Happy to share Kayo with you today.

In this file, you will find our Figma file that we used to prototype the game extremely quickly, and Unity version with a AI vs AI behavior.

I invite you to use the Figma file, and launch the prototype from the landing page to discover the full experience!
