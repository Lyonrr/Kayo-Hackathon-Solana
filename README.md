# Solana-Summer-Camp

Hi Solana team! Happy to share Kayo with you today.

In this repo, you will find:
- Our Figma file that we used to prototype the game extremely quickly. It is in a PDF format so that you can go through it easily. It is the core of our experience, as it gives you a full-idea of the concept.
- A Unity version with a AI vs AI behavior

All visuals (3D models, animation clips, UI elements, brand guidelines) are home-made.

Hope you enjoy it! And thanks for this great event! :)
